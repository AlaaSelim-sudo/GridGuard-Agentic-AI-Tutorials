# Instructor Guide: Hands-on Three Operator Cases

80 static slides / 180.0 minutes. Getting started and agent basics: 16 slides / 29.5 minutes; Voltage support: 17 slides / 36 minutes; Service restoration: 14 slides / 28 minutes; Cyber response: 16 slides / 32 minutes; Llama walkthrough and operator practice: 17 slides / 54.5 minutes. Follow the L labels and stable notebook cell IDs; predict, run, edit and interpret each result. The three exercises have separate teacher notes and debriefs. Numerical calculations and archived model replies remain distinct. No tables, transitions or click reveals.

## 1. Hands-on: Three Operator Cases

00:00–00:30 / 0.5 minutes.

Open Classroom Labs before the workshop. Participants will run fresh numerical calculations and inspect clearly labeled archived model replies. Use the same notebook for all three cases. If devices are limited, work in pairs: one person runs the cells while the other checks the evidence. The deck uses the IEEE ComSoc theme. The classroom cycle is run, change, check and explain. This expanded edition includes a new L10B replay and a proposed control-room advisory pilot. The scheduled teaching time is 180 minutes; allow breaks outside that total.

## 2. What would an operator ask an assistant to do?

00:30–03:00 / 2.5 minutes.

Start with the operator’s job, not the model name. Read the illustrative request aloud. Ask participants to name the information they would need before making the study. This is a teaching design for an advisory assistant. The classroom notebook provides numerical counterparts for selected steps, not a live control-room connection.

## 3. What makes this an LLM agent?

03:00–05:30 / 2.5 minutes.

Use Anthropic’s attributed architectural distinction. A conventional program can contain feedback, branches, rules and sophisticated optimization. Those alone do not demonstrate an LLM agent. A generative model can also just write an explanation. In these records Llama makes bounded choices from an allowed list, receives tool evidence and may select another step. This is narrow agency, not unrestricted autonomy. The default class replays those choices.

## 4. Llama, Python and the operator have different jobs

05:30–08:00 / 2.5 minutes.

Llama is the language model, Ollama is the local service used to run it, and the application controls which tools can execute. Our recorded wrappers return schema-constrained JSON choices. They do not use Ollama’s native tool_calls protocol. Python validates and interprets the choice before calling numerical functions. Good JSON formatting does not make a claim physically correct. No classroom cell sends an equipment command.

## 5. An agent needs a goal, tools and a place to stop

08:00–10:30 / 2.5 minutes.

Walk around the loop once. State means the saved case record: input snapshot, selected candidate, tool outcomes and remaining study budget. A tool is an application function, such as running a power-flow check or solving a restoration problem. The engineering model, allowed actions, limits and stop conditions belong to the application. A model can request REVIEW when the permitted route cannot resolve a problem. In the original P3 record only two candidate checks are allowed.

## 6. A useful explanation makes a claim we can check

10:30–13:00 / 2.5 minutes.

We show only the public reasons returned in the recorded JSON. We do not expose or infer private internal reasoning. Ask whether the statement matches the input, respects the allowed choices and survives the numerical check. Later the restoration reply says it sorted costs correctly while returning the wrong order. That specific error is an opportunity to inspect the application’s guard.

## 7. Six terms we will use in the notebook

13:00–15:30 / 2.5 minutes.

MPC plans controls using a forecast. SAC supplies a proposal from a previously trained controller. MILP chooses whole loads while respecting the stated constraints. WLS finds the state that best fits the weighted readings. Evidence binding checks that inputs and command still match a stored result. Model scope means which network parts and physical effects were included. Also define p.u. as a value divided by its stated base: 1.0 p.u. is that base value. A thermal limit here is a current or flow limit. The objective or cost is the numerical score to optimize after required checks pass.

## 8. Know what is running and what is being replayed

15:30–18:00 / 2.5 minutes.

Point to these evidence modes throughout the session. Default classroom cells calculate fresh results without a live language-model call. L10B displays verified historical Llama choices, original reasons and associated recorded results. Changing your L2 or L6 input does not change those old replies. The final control-room diagrams are a proposed teaching design, not evidence of a deployed utility platform. No new equipment operation occurs in any of these modes.

## 9. Open one notebook for all three cases

18:00–19:30 / 1.5 minutes.

Open https://alaaselim-sudo.github.io/GridGuard-Agentic-AI-Tutorials/#notebooks and choose the first notebook, Classroom Labs. The LangGraph and trace notebooks are separate companions. Keep the slides in one tab and Classroom Labs in another.

## 10. Connect a CPU and run setup

19:30–21:30 / 2 minutes.

For a paced workshop, run the setup cell first, then run each named lesson cell when prompted. Runtime > Run all also works, but it reveals later outputs before the prediction questions. The default route needs no GPU, API key or LLM download. If setup stops, reconnect the runtime and rerun setup before starting L0.

## 11. Find each task by its L label

21:30–22:30 / 1 minutes.

The added Colab setup cells changed the numerical cell positions. Use the L headings and stable cell IDs to find the same source in Colab, Jupyter and these slides. A slide shows only the relevant code fragment. Students should run the complete matching notebook cell.

## 12. Run L0: choose the classroom route

22:30–24:30 / 2 minutes.

Run all of L0 to import the helpers, configure the plots and initialize the timing record. Keep RUN_OPENDSS=False and RUN_LOCAL_LLAMA=False. These settings skip the optional full-feeder OpenDSS route and local model service. They do not make the calculations prerecorded: L2 and L4 through L9 run fresh numerical calculations or checks, while L12 checks the evidence binding and simulated readback.

RUN_LOCAL_LLAMA = False   # True: one optional local call in L11
ROOT = Path.cwd()
assert (ROOT / 'data/lindistflow3_network.json').exists(), 'Start Jupyter in the tutorial folder'
```

## 13. New results, saved controller, old replies

24:30–26:00 / 1.5 minutes.

A script follows rules written in code. An LLM agent can choose the next allowed tool from a task and the returned results. The diagram shows proposed responsibilities, not a live agent run in this notebook. Ordinary Python functions do the engineering calculations here; the notebook does not run through LangGraph. A saved policy uses learned weights to calculate a new proposal without retraining. Displaying an old language-model reply does not make a new model call. A language model does not replace the power-flow calculation, load-selection solver or state estimator.

## 14. Run L1: does the evidence still match?

26:00–27:30 / 1.5 minutes.

Evidence binding means matching a checked record to the exact inputs, proposed command and returned result, using content hashes. Treat L1 as a same-content check, not a test that a physical action passes its limits. The first row keeps the request and command unchanged. The next two rows change a request field or command field, so binding_pass is True, False, False. A failed match calls for new evidence; it does not prove the changed action fails its limits. A matching hash also does not authenticate a sensor.

## 15. Use the same experiment cycle

27:30–28:30 / 1 minutes.

Pause before showing each output. Ask pairs to write one sentence predicting the change, then compare it with the calculated result. Keep the input values and evidence together. Change only one parameter in the first experiment.

## 16. Keep a short experiment record

28:30–29:30 / 1 minutes.

Participants can add a text cell below an output or use paper notes; no extra software is needed. Each pair should finish with one changed-input experiment that another person can repeat. Explain the result and one limit on the claim. The three cases use different networks and do not form a single utility deployment study. Model scope means which parts of the network, quantities and physical effects the calculation covers.

## 17. Voltage: open L2

29:30–31:30 / 2 minutes.

The feeder is a synthetic SMART-DS Greensboro-area example, not a measured utility circuit. The command sets active- and reactive-power participation for an inverter fleet. MPC, model predictive control, uses a system model and a short forecast to calculate a plan under limits; here the proposed command is the first step of that plan. SAC, Soft Actor–Critic, is a saved controller learned from rewards. It produces a proposal from old weights without training again. The default calculation covers medium-voltage (MV) phases and MV line currents, with simplified low-voltage (LV) aggregation. Feasible means the proposal passes the limits represented by that model. Compare the penalty score J only after checking those limits; smaller J is preferred for this stated objective. Run L0 and L1 first.

## 18. Control settings and limits

31:30–33:30 / 2 minutes.

Active power delivers net energy; reactive power supports the AC voltage and current balance. The command uses P_i = a S_i and Q_i = b S_i. Its bounds are 0 <= a <= 1, |b| <= 0.44 and a^2 + b^2 <= 1. Modeled voltages must be between 0.95 and 1.05 per unit (p.u.), where values are divided by a stated base. RATING_FRACTION=0.80 sets allowed current to 80% of the nominal rating. The displayed current percentage uses this reduced allowance as its denominator. Passing the inverter bounds alone does not show that network limits pass.

## 19. Run L2 with the default inputs

33:30–35:30 / 2 minutes.

Start with LOAD_SCALE=1.0 and RATING_FRACTION=0.80. The saved SAC actor produces a new proposal by inference; it is not trained in this cell. Both proposals pass the default classroom checks. MPC has the lower current-step J for this case and objective. This single result does not establish a universal control advantage. The output field feasible reports whether the modeled limits pass; current_step_J is this step’s penalty score, and max_allowed_current_pct is maximum current as a percentage of the reduced allowance.

## 20. Read the voltage and current plots

35:30–37:30 / 2 minutes.

The left panel sorts each voltage curve separately. The same horizontal position means the same rank, not necessarily the same physical bus. The right panel reports current relative to the reduced allowance. Use the output table for exact extrema and feasibility; do not decide acceptance from a plot alone.

## 21. Check limits before comparing scores

37:30–39:30 / 2 minutes.

In the reference execution, MPC returns a=0.960307 and b=-0.111114, with Vmin=1.023874 and Vmax=1.038709 p.u. SAC returns a=0.340066 and b=0.014024, with Vmin=1.013243 and Vmax=1.030000 p.u. Values may vary slightly with the solver or dependency version. Lower current use need not mean lower J, because the objective also includes service and control terms. Check feasibility before comparing J. Both voltage extrema are within the stated 0.95–1.05 p.u. band for this represented MV model.

## 22. Exercise 1: tighten the current allowance

39:30–43:30 / 4 minutes.

Allow one minute to predict, two minutes to edit and run, and one minute to report. Keep LOAD_SCALE=1.0. Reference allowed-current use is 78.527895% for MPC and 54.854158% for SAC; both remain feasible. Do not ask learners to find a rejection that this edit does not produce. The default model still covers MV only.

## 23. Debrief: both proposals still pass

43:30–45:30 / 2 minutes.

An incorrect prediction is useful evidence, not a failed exercise. Compare the hypothesis with the actual output. Both candidates retain enough headroom in this case. An optimizer may change its command when a constraint changes, so a simple fixed-ratio argument does not apply to every scenario. The model scope has not expanded.

## 24. Reset L2 before reading old model choices

45:30–47:30 / 2 minutes.

Make the experiment boundary explicit. L3 loads a separate preserved context into pool. It does not inherit the fresh L2 case or the participant's edits. Do not pair an edited L2 result with the test_01 model explanation as though the model had seen those new inputs.

## 25. L3 opens a separate recorded case

47:30–49:30 / 2 minutes.

The output contains three actual replies from the frozen response-selection study. Ask learners to identify the operation and numerical parameters requested by each reply. The reported seconds measure the original model calls, not today's display cell. Keep this archived context separate from the fresh L2 comparison.

```

## 26. What did the models choose?

49:30–51:30 / 2 minutes.

The three old replies reduce to two distinct operations after matching their tool names and numerical parameters. The vote keeps one contribution per model. In test_01, two models vote for the Q-relaxation trial, which relaxes a reactive-power restriction in that declared test. This diagram shows the old input and choices; it is not a new vote after a learner edits L2. Grouping matching trials avoids counting different wording as different physical proposals.

## 27. Run L4: check the old choice again

51:30–53:30 / 2 minutes.

The selector is frozen and makes no training updates in this lesson. L4 applies the archived selected operation to its original test context and runs a fresh numerical check. This is a replay with new verification, not a new language-model decision or an online learning experiment. LinUCB is a learned selector that scores the available choices from context; its saved settings stay fixed here.

## 28. Separate the old choice from the new check

53:30–55:30 / 2 minutes.

The reference J is about 0.031082 for both selectors. The predicted reward is around -0.0075. It is a learned score, not a feasibility flag. Read new_check_passes for the engineering result. This one case does not show that learned selection is better than voting.

## 29. Run L5: check what the model covers

55:30–57:30 / 2 minutes.

L5 rebuilds the original test_01 case and runs a new check on its original MV-MPC incumbent, meaning the baseline plan saved with that case. This is not the reactive-power-relaxation candidate checked in L4. With RUN_OPENDSS=False, L5 checks only the reduced model and reports that OpenDSS is disabled. This CPU route performs no new full-feeder AC check. A wider-model study saved earlier is not a result calculated today. Model scope means the network parts and physical effects that a check represents.

## 30. A PASS covers only the model checked

57:30–59:30 / 2 minutes.

Ask a participant to read the explicit scope message aloud. A PASS is conditional on the model and action that were checked. The default model does not cover every LV constraint. A more confident explanation cannot supply the missing model coverage.

## 31. Preview the L12 handover

59:30–61:30 / 2 minutes.

Preview the purpose of the final handoff without asking participants to jump ahead. L12 will use selected_trials from L4, not the fresh L2 comparison. It contrasts a full MV/LV request with an explicit MV-only teaching request. Continue to L6 after the voltage checkpoint, finish L6–L11, and run L12 once in the closing section. The readback is a simulated teaching event with no equipment dispatch.

61:30–63:30 / 2 minutes.

This screenshot previews the executed default L12 result; students have not run L12 yet. At the final step they will check the returned state and acknowledgment fields. The full-coverage request remains HOLD; the explicit MV teaching scope allows a simulated readback. The simulation does not complete human approval of an archived study and does not dispatch equipment.

## 33. Voltage checkpoint: say what ran

63:30–65:30 / 2 minutes.

Give pairs 30 seconds to describe the sequence without calling every step an AI decision. L2 calculates an MPC plan and a saved-policy proposal for the current classroom inputs. L3 displays old model replies. L4 runs new checks of the selected trials; L5 checks the original archived plan and its model coverage. Numerical tools provide the physical evidence. The old model choices select a permitted trial; they do not replace these checks. The operator receives an advisory record whose stated coverage must match the request.

## 34. Restoration: open L6

65:30–66:30 / 1 minutes.

This six-node graph is separate from the voltage feeder. It represents active-power transport, not AC power flow or a time-ordered field switching procedure. Loads are picked up as whole blocks. A tie is an alternative connection that can supply load; CAPACITIES_KW sets its transfer limit in kilowatts.

## 35. Choose the service goal before the plan

66:30–68:30 / 2 minutes.

Critical demand totals 90 kW: 60 kW at node 2 and 30 kW at node 5. The objective is the service goal encoded as a score. The priority score gives more weight to these critical loads, while the comparison score maximizes total kW. The difference in selected service comes from that goal. Both numerical methods use the same graph, capacities and whole-load pickup rules. Neither needs a language model to solve this declared problem.

## 36. Run L6: change the tie capacity

68:30–70:30 / 2 minutes.

MILP means mixed-integer linear programming. Here it is a whole-load chooser: on/off choices decide which load blocks are served, while linear constraints enforce the stated network rules. Start with tie capacities of 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 kW. The solver enforces active-power balance, capacity limits, connection to a source, no loops in the energized graph, and exclusion of the faulted branch. An independent exhaustive search checks the priority score on this small graph. Agreement supports this formulation; it does not check the AC physics left out of the model.

display(restoration['table'].drop(columns='pickup'))
```

## 37. Read both service plots

70:30–72:30 / 2 minutes.

The markers show sampled capacities rather than a continuous ramp between whole-load pickup plans. A higher capacity may still be too small to add another complete load block. Read both total and critical service before choosing the policy that matches the request.

## 38. The tradeoff at a 40 kW tie limit

72:30–74:30 / 2 minutes.

Compare the first two output rows, where tie_capacity_kw=40. The priority plan serves 10 kW less total demand while preserving 60 kW more critical demand. These results compare two service objectives, not AI with no AI.

## 39. How Python checks the plan

74:30–76:30 / 2 minutes.

Numerical checks and same-content evidence matching answer different questions. A record can match the inputs exactly while still omitting AC voltage, reactive-power or protection limits. Comparing the MILP score with every permitted plan is an independent check of this small stated problem. Minimizing energized branches does not calculate the number or order of physical switching steps.

## 40. Exercise 2: add more tie capacity

76:30–80:30 / 4 minutes.

Allow one minute to predict, two minutes to edit and run, and one minute to report. At 180 kW, both methods serve 250 kW total and 90 kW critical demand. Keep 40 kW first in the list because L7 binds the first result to the first capacity. Do not reorder the list for this exercise.

## 41. Debrief: the tradeoff disappears here

80:30–82:30 / 2 minutes.

Compare the 180 kW result with the 40 kW case before generalizing. Equal service at 180 kW follows from this small graph and its demands; it is not a universal threshold. A single success percentage would hide the service-policy question.

## 42. Reset the capacity list, then run L7

82:30–84:30 / 2 minutes.

Keeping 40 kW first already preserves the L7 example. Resetting the list also makes the saved notebook easy to compare with the default. L7 changes the request capacity and revision without solving a new case. It tests whether the old evidence can still be used.

```

## 43. Read the evidence-match test

84:30–86:30 / 2 minutes.

This output reports evidence binding, not physical infeasibility. A separate fresh solve at 20 kW still gives the 130 kW total and 90 kW critical priority outcome on this graph. L7 itself does not run that solve. Replace the stale evidence because it belongs to a different request, even when the old plan might remain feasible.

## 44. Changed inputs need a new check

86:30–88:30 / 2 minutes.

Evidence binding asks whether a record matches the exact request, proposed plan and returned result. The diagram’s extra topology labels are teaching illustrations. The runnable L7 example changes only the request capacity and revision; students do not change topology in that cell. Old evidence is unusable for a changed request even if the old plan might still pass its limits. Ask which new numerical check would establish that for the changed request.

## 45. Proposed agent role: keep the service goal

88:30–90:30 / 2 minutes.

This is a proposed role for an agent, not a new model decision in the default notebook. The current supervisor is ordinary Python. A future language-model agent could request the allowed solve and explain the returned tradeoff. It must preserve the operator’s service goal and limits, rather than quietly changing weights or making up load values. A different service goal requires an explicit new request and solve. The numerical difference here comes from the optimization objective.

## 46. What this model does not check

## 47. Restoration checkpoint: name the next step

91:30–93:30 / 2 minutes.

Ask each pair to give one number and one condition. They should distinguish three decisions: selecting a service policy, checking current evidence and authorizing a physical switching operation.

## 48. Cyber: open L8

93:30–94:30 / 1 minutes.

The separate four-bus linear DC model has three unknown voltage angles, measured relative to a reference bus, and eight readings. This DC approximation is not a full AC estimator, malware detector or sensor-authentication system. Synthetic truth is known for the offline classroom comparison only. A residual checks how well the estimate fits the supplied readings; state error checks how far the estimate is from the known teaching truth.

## 49. Best fit and true state are different

94:30–96:30 / 2 minutes.

WLS means weighted least squares: find the state that best fits the readings, giving more influence to readings with smaller stated uncertainty. That weighting does not authenticate a reading. Here J is the residual mismatch statistic, not the voltage case’s penalty score. Its chi-square alarm threshold is about 15.086272 for five residual degrees of freedom at a 1% significance level. This calibration depends on the stated linear model and noise assumptions. An operator does not have the synthetic truth used to calculate the plotted state error. A small J does not establish that the readings are authentic.

## 50. Run L8: compare two data attacks

96:30–98:30 / 2 minutes.

L8 runs new WLS calculations. An isolated bias changes one reading. The coordinated Hc shift changes readings in a pattern consistent with a different modeled state. This counterexample assumes knowledge of the linear measurement matrix H and access to the modeled unprotected channels. It is a declared defensive teaching model, not evidence of an incident at a utility.

## 51. Read both cyber plots

98:30–100:30 / 2 minutes.

The left plot uses a symmetric-log scale. The right plot compares the estimate with known synthetic truth. As the coordinated shift grows, the residual stays unchanged while the state error increases. These plots answer different questions; they do not express the same quantity in different units.

## 52. At scale 1, the alarm misses a state error

100:30–102:30 / 2 minutes.

The diagram is a simple scalar illustration of coordinated consistency, not the numerical eight-measurement system. Read the numerical values from L8. A larger false-data shift need not increase the residual when the shift lies in the modeled measurement subspace. The state error is measured in radians; it is available here because this is an offline test with known synthetic truth.

## 53. Exercise 3: add a small isolated bias

102:30–106:30 / 4 minutes.

Allow one minute to predict, two minutes to edit and run, and one minute to report. For isolated bias at scale 0.10, J is about 10.143237, below the 15.086272 threshold. The alarm is False despite nonzero state error. The coordinated residual stays about 3.920222. This added scale remains within the notebook's plot limits.

## 54. Debrief: no alarm does not prove truth

106:30–108:30 / 2 minutes.

Separate the two mechanisms. A small isolated bias can stay below a statistical threshold. A coordinated Hc shift can preserve residual consistency by construction. Neither result establishes trusted telemetry. The state-error curve uses offline synthetic truth, not an input available to an online detector.

## 55. Reset L8 before the recovery example

## 56. L9 uses a fixed recovery case

109:30–111:30 / 2 minutes.

The helper uses the fixed run_wls_demo recovery fixture. The cyber object holds both the sweep results and this shared fixed demo. The comparison tests the trust premise under controlled conditions; it is not a controller reacting continuously to each plotted scale.

## 57. Trusted readings are an assumption

111:30–113:30 / 2 minutes.

The example assumes three protected angle readings determine the three unknown angles, leaving zero residual degrees of freedom. Independent trusted information must come from a justified source outside this numerical calculation. A zero residual in this exactly determined system adds no detection guarantee. Neither a good model fit nor a language-model explanation establishes authenticity.

## 58. Run L9: compare HOLD and PROPOSE

113:30–115:30 / 2 minutes.

The two calls use the same fixed fixture and change only protected_available. Without the trusted channels, the result is HOLD. With the assumed trusted set, it is PROPOSE. A proposal is neither an acknowledgment nor a dispatch command.

## 59. Read the two decision states

115:30–117:30 / 2 minutes.

Read the condition column together with the returned state. The PROPOSE outcome depends on the supplied trust assumption and fixed model. The recovery record keeps dispatch=False. It does not use the equipment_dispatch field from the separate L12 readback example.

## 60. Check the numerical correction

117:30–119:30 / 2 minutes.

QP means quadratic programming: this numerical solver minimizes a quadratic effort score while enforcing the declared branch limits and a 0.01 p.u. margin. The flexible injection is u=0.1216936673 p.u., balanced by the reference bus. Predicted flow12 is 0.17000 p.u.; the offline actual flow is about 0.17046 p.u., below the 0.18000 p.u. rating. The actual-flow comparison uses synthetic truth for this fixed case. It does not guarantee AC behavior omitted by the model or trustworthy field telemetry.

## 61. What makes the recovery possible?

119:30–121:30 / 2 minutes.

Do not attribute recovered information or numerical feasibility to confident prose. The workflow can coordinate the estimator, constrained correction and evidence checks. It cannot invent an independent trusted measurement source.

## 62. Proposed agent role: request and explain

121:30–123:30 / 2 minutes.

The default classroom calls are ordinary deterministic Python functions, so this cell makes no new language-model decision. The slide states a proposed agent responsibility: request the allowed estimator and control tool, then explain the exact conditions returned. The operator must establish the basis for trusting the replacement readings and review the limited proposal through the authorized process. The old model explanations in L10 come from a separate historical study and are not replies to this participant’s changed inputs.

## 63. Cyber checkpoint: explain why PROPOSE is allowed

123:30–125:30 / 2 minutes.

Ask pairs to state the outcome and its condition in the same sentence. For example: 'The fixture proposes u when the supplied trusted channels are available.' Do not say: 'The AI proved that the telemetry is safe.'

## 64. Run L10 before the Llama walkthrough

125:30–128:30 / 3 minutes.

L10 reads the archived proposal_complete_workflow study. It includes feeder-catalog restoration and is separate from the L6 six-node MILP and your edited classroom inputs. L10B, inserted immediately after L10, then gives readable verified replay episodes for all three cases. Run L11 after those replays; the default False setting skips a new local model request.

## 65. Run L10B: watch Llama choose a tool

128:30–131:00 / 2.5 minutes.

Run L10 first. In the new L10B cell the helper validates the original JSON reply against the parsed journal and trace, then displays the recorded episode. Change only SCENARIO to inspect the other two episodes. The following slides show selected fields from the same replay. This cell makes no model request and performs no new electrical solve. At the end, run L11 at its default False setting before L12. Llama reasons are historical public returned text. Their correctness must be judged against the input and tool results. SCENARIO can be voltage, restoration or cyber. The full cell is shown.

## 66. Voltage: Llama asks to check the saved controller

131:00–133:30 / 2.5 minutes.

Read the exact reason. The model was offered VERIFY_SAC_FIRST or REVIEW. The application then checks the saved SAC action in OpenDSS. 111.966607% refers to the allowed current, which was 80% of nominal, so this exceeds the configured allowance. The numerical result records two current violations. This P3 full supplied MV/LV study is separate from L2 and L3 test_01. Ask the audience to predict the next allowed step before advancing.

## 67. Voltage: Llama chooses the existing fallback plan

133:30–136:00 / 2.5 minutes.

The model selects USE_MPC_PLAN from two allowed choices, the other being REVIEW. It does not invent or solve MPC. The recorded context already supplies a plan and its eligibility. The application performs a fresh numerical check at that historical time. The result is just below the allowed current threshold. No operating permission follows from this check alone. Ask which evidence, rather than wording, makes the fallback eligible for review.

## 68. Voltage: the checks pass and human review remains

136:00–138:30 / 2.5 minutes.

Read the exact REVIEW_EVIDENCE choice and distinguish it from the overall status. The proposed controls are 2387.157 kW and +325.738 kvar. The supplied full MV/LV feeder check returned voltage 1.001783–1.035026 p.u. and zero listed violations. The fixed supervisor used the same SAC-to-MPC sequence with identical numerical output. Recorded workflow intervals were 0.346053 s fixed and 3.110454 s agentic, excluding precomputed MPC/SAC preparation. These are single recorded timings, not performance distributions or a measured reduction in operator workload.

## 69. Restoration: Llama chooses a useful new trial

138:30–141:00 / 2.5 minutes.

Switch L10B to restoration. This is the separate L10 feeder-catalog restoration study, not the L6 six-node MILP. The recorded protocol requires a first refinement but Llama chooses between the offered fractions. SHED_075 disconnects 75% of the ordered noncritical load objects, not 75% of load kW. The exact reason calls improvement a possibility. Python evaluates the trial and finds improved service while the tie loading remains 91.867215% of its allowance. A useful hypothesis becomes evidence only after that check.

## 70. Restoration: the next trial crosses the current limit

141:00–143:30 / 2.5 minutes.

Keep the actual returned reason visible. It refers to a target in the objective, but its claim should not be accepted as a proved fact. In this record the next trial is numerically rejected for a thermal failure. Restoring more load does not make a failed current check acceptable. Ask participants to explain why the previous passed candidate must remain in the case record. The model’s trial budget is bounded.

## 71. Restoration: catch Llama’s wrong ranking

143:30–146:00 / 2.5 minutes.

Let pairs answer before discussing the result. Smaller cost is better, so E03 must rank before E02. Llama returns [E02,E03] while its explanation claims lowest score first. The recorded language_order_agrees_with_cost field is False. A deterministic guard retains E03 and rechecks it as E05, with no recorded failures. Human acknowledgment and dispatch remain False. The paired fixed workflow reaches the same final action and cost. This example motivates verification rather than an unsupported superiority claim.

## 72. Cyber: Llama selects the tool already allowed

146:00–148:30 / 2.5 minutes.

Switch L10B to cyber. This standard four-bus DC record is separate from L10’s proposal-complete cyber record, and matches the Agent Trace notebook T6 archive. The route is narrow: the prompt already authorizes the tool and supplies the trusted-sensor assumption. The three angle readings give full rank but zero residual redundancy, so a good fit is not an independent trust test. u is the flexible injection correction in per unit. Offline synthetic-truth flow is available to the experimenter, not guaranteed available to a real operator.

## 73. Cyber: a passing calculation still needs review

148:30–151:00 / 2.5 minutes.

Read the actual reply, including the REVIEW choice. Numerical verification is PASS, but the overall result remains REVIEW and human acknowledgment is PENDING. The fixed comparator obtains the same numerical state estimate and correction without Llama. This replay demonstrates permitted tool routing and a report decision. It does not demonstrate better estimation, authenticated measurements, AC network security or operating authority. Run L11 with the default False setting, then proceed to L12.

## 74. Finish L12: practice the readback

151:00–155:00 / 4 minutes.

This cell returns to the original test_01 voltage result through selected_trials. It does not use the restoration or cyber sweeps. Read both scope outcomes and explain why the full MV/LV request remains HOLD. The new simulated acknowledgment grants no physical operating authority and does not complete the review of an old record. Readback means repeating the recommendation ID and conditions so the acknowledgment can be matched to the same proposal. In this exercise it is simulated. Check the wrong-ID rejection, the correct simulated acknowledgment and equipment_dispatch=False.

## 75. Start a control-room pilot with a clear study request

155:00–159:00 / 4 minutes.

Proposed advisory pilot, not a deployment claim. F12 is an illustrative teaching feeder name. Read the study request aloud: compare the allowed voltage-support options, keep the stated current and voltage limits, show the worst margins and missing checks, and return a recommendation for review. The data owner defines acceptable age, source and quality rules. L1 and L7 illustrate matching inputs to results, but hashes alone do not authenticate those sources.

## 76. Give the assistant a small, controlled tool list

159:00–163:00 / 4 minutes.

Proposed advisory pilot. Walk through the lanes: operator, assistant, application-controlled tool gateway and engineering tools. Llama requests one permitted function; the application checks the request and executes the tool. A snapshot identifier binds the result to the input. The workshop Python functions are teaching counterparts, not SCADA adapters. NIST OT guidance supports controlled information flows, least privilege and logging. The exact pilot architecture is our teaching recommendation, not a NIST-certified design.

## 77. Check three things before returning a proposal

163:00–167:00 / 4 minutes.

Proposed advisory pilot. Current data and a matching evidence packet are the first gate. The second gate checks stated engineering limits with approved tools. The third asks whether the calculations cover the request, including excluded low-voltage parts or required protection and dynamic studies. This is not a universal complete security checklist. It illustrates why L12 can produce a passing local calculation and still HOLD a broader request. Make missing evidence visible instead of allowing fluent text to fill the gap.

## 78. Give the operator a short evidence packet

167:00–171:00 / 4 minutes.

Proposed advisory pilot. Use three review questions: Does this match the current equipment, inputs and model? Did the required checks pass, with missing checks clear? What exactly am I approving, who owns the next step, and where is the record? Record the reviewer, reason, case snapshot and tool versions. Accepting a study result does not itself issue an equipment command. Authorized operating procedures and roles determine any later physical action. L12 practices only a simulated ID-bound readback.

## 79. Adopt it in stages and measure the benefit

171:00–175:00 / 4 minutes.

Proposed advisory pilot. Historical replay lets engineers define expected outcomes and failure cases. Shadow use compares recommendations alongside the existing process without relying on them for equipment control. A limited pilot needs a named owner, training, an agreed scope and a way to stop use. Measure end-to-end elapsed time including review, correct completed studies, missed or stale inputs, overlooked limits and reviewer changes. Compare the same engineering tools with and without Llama. Our paired records show identical final numerical results, so there is no basis yet to promise higher accuracy, less operator workload or faster decisions. NIST AI RMF supports human roles, evaluation under realistic conditions and deactivation; these particular pilot metrics are our recommendation.
