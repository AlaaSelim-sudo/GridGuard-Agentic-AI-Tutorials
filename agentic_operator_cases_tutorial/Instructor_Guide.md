Numerical calculations and archived model replies remain distinct. No tables, transitions or click reveals.

## 1. Hands-on: Three Operator Cases

00:00–01:00 / 1 minutes.

One Classroom Labs notebook covers all three cases. Follow the L labels in order, keep both optional-tool switches False and use the saved Llama examples after the numerical cases. Learners can follow along during the 90-minute lecture and finish the experiments afterward. Presenters and affiliations are supplied by the presenters.

## 2. An agent chooses what to try next

01:00–02:00 / 1 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: The agent coordinates the work. The numerical tool supplies the engineering result. An error can also guide the next request.

Original source detail: Use the architectural definition in Anthropic, Building effective agents: an agent lets the LLM direct its process and tool use. Agentic AI is a broad term; here it means a system organized around this bounded loop. An AI agent is the component that chooses and follows steps. A tool is a permitted software function that returns a result. Point to the goal, model choice, executable tool, returned evidence and feedback arrow. The application stores case facts and prior results as the context supplied at the next model request. If a required check is missing, the outcome remains HOLD. Stop or return a proposal only under the fixed workflow rules. Do not imply that feedback alone establishes agency: conventional programs can also branch and loop. Our default notebook calculates engineering results now but replays the actual old Llama choices. No live model service is needed. Stanford source: Monica Lam, CS224V Agentic AI, Lecture 1: Introduction, Fall 2026, p.2 describes function calling and agentic workflows. The goal-and-feedback drawing is our grid teaching adaptation, supported by the separate bounded-agent architecture citation. This is not an original Stanford power-system diagram.

## 3. The agent asks; the tool calculates

02:00–02:30 / 0.5 minutes.

Show the two original capability panels from Monica Lam’s Stanford CS224V introduction, p.2. The left panel introduces model-selected function calling. The right panel describes multi-step planning, tool use and self-correction. Our plain-language sentence connects the panels to the preceding bounded-loop teaching drawing. The following source-and-lab pairs show why tool results, explicit goals and checked evidence matter in each case. In that example Llama requests a named action and Python validates the JSON choice before calling an existing function; it does not use a native tool_calls protocol. Conventional software can also loop, and a chatbot may itself contain an agent. Here we identify the agentic feature by the model’s permitted next-step choice based on returned evidence. The class replays those old model choices while numerical cells calculate current results. Source lecture figure is shown unchanged within the documented crop.

## 4. Check the evidence before answering

02:30–03:00 / 0.5 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: Stanford’s example checks claims before writing an answer. Our grid adaptation checks numerical evidence before presenting a recommendation.

Original source detail: The displayed figure is an original excerpt from Monica Lam’s Stanford CS224V introduction, p.19. Follow its retrieval, claim checking and writing steps. The WikiChat paper is fully cited in the reading guide. Our application to grid studies is a teaching analogy: read the stated limits, run the appropriate numerical check and summarize the actual returned result. Ask which lab step would detect a current violation. The classroom notebook does not run WikiChat; its dialogue factuality measurements are not electrical performance results. This source figure is now in the opening. Spend about one minute on the check-before-writing idea. The next slide maps it to L2; do not run a cell yet.

## 5. Solar settings: which option should we try?

03:00–03:30 / 0.5 minutes.

Connect the preceding original WikiChat figure to a grid claim. A text answer might say that a proposed plan fits the limits; a numerical tool must calculate the supporting result. The reference bar is the default L2 MPC result: maximum allowed-current utilization 73.619901%, rounded to 73.62%, at LOAD_SCALE=1.0 and RATING_FRACTION=0.80. It passes this current allowance; modeled voltage and required model coverage must also be checked. The default medium-voltage calculation is not proof for the full MV/LV system. This visual previews the lab; do not run L2 before setup, L0 and L1. L2 calls numerical functions directly. The separate P3 L10B archive later shows Llama requesting a check, reading a failed result and selecting a fallback. Our application is an analogy to evidence checking, not a claim that the notebook runs WikiChat.

## 6. Give the agent a goal and clear limits

03:30–04:30 / 1 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: These rules belong to the application and operating process. A persuasive model response cannot change them.

Original source detail: Stanford connection: Lam p.40 and the published Genie Worksheets paper emphasize developer-defined workflows and knowledge sources. The published framework uses an algorithmic runtime to enforce a supplied policy, with LLMs used for language understanding and response generation. Our lab uses custom Python functions, not Genie Worksheets. The application analogy is to specify the task and prevent a language reply from silently changing its limits or filling missing required inputs. A passed calculation does not prove that the task description was correct. The figure shown here is an actual excerpt from the supplied Stanford lecture. Ask the audience to point to the claim-checking or policy step, then identify the corresponding Python check in our lab. We borrow the design habit; the notebook does not run WikiChat or Genie. Their non-grid benchmarks are not electrical performance results.

## 7. Restoration: who should get power first?

04:30–05:00 / 0.5 minutes.

The preceding Genie excerpt motivates writing down the task and its rules before calling a function. In L6 the goal is part of the optimization problem: priority weighting serves 130 total kW, including 90 critical kW; maximizing total service gives 140 total kW, including 30 critical kW. The 40 kW limit belongs to one varied tie, while another tie stays fixed at 100 kW. Totals also include the 40 kW load at node 1 upstream of those ties. A 40 kW varied-tie limit is not a cap on total system service. Each stacked bar uses the same scale. Critical service is cyan; other service is blue. Ask which goal better matches an illustrative request to prioritize a hospital. The numerical model uses abstract critical loads, not an actual hospital dataset. Later learners run both goals and change the tie capacity. L6 is a direct Python calculation, not a live LLM agent. An agent coordinating such a study must preserve the requested goal and explain the returned tradeoff. The separate L10B feeder-catalog archive supplies actual saved Llama choices; it differs from this six-node L6 model. Our notebook does not implement Genie Worksheets.

## 8. Keep three jobs clear

05:00–05:30 / 0.5 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: Keep the three responsibilities separate when reading the examples. A fluent explanation is not a substitute for the calculation.

Original source detail: This original diagram selection comes from the function row on p.53 of Monica Lam’s introduction. It shows a clinical-trial example, not a power-system experiment. The language model translates written facts into an SMT representation; a separate solver derives a decision from those constraints. SMT means satisfiability modulo theories, a way to express and solve logical constraints. MaxSAT supports the lecture’s search for conditions that change a decision. The lecture also states that the formalization may not be completely faithful, so correctness remains relative to the represented constraints. Our application is an analogy: Llama requests the permitted estimate or control tool and Python checks numerical limits. An operator must still confirm the trust assumption and review the proposed action. Our notebook does not run an SMT/MaxSAT solver or prove formal electrical safety. Preview the HOLD/PROPOSE distinction now; participants will calculate the L9 outcomes later with their stated model and trusted-data assumption.

## 9. Wrong readings can still fit a model

05:30–06:00 / 0.5 minutes.

Relate the original Stanford clinical example to this lab without importing a formal guarantee. L8 fits readings to a four-bus DC model using WLS, weighted least squares. Its small residual is a measure of fit, not proof of sensor truth; the known simulation truth is used only for teaching error comparisons. L9 is a separate fixed recovery fixture. Without trusted replacement data it returns HOLD. With three additional readings assumed trusted and a successful modeled recovery check, it returns PROPOSE. The yes branch depicts this fixed example with passing numerical checks; a real study also needs every required check to pass. The calculation does not authenticate the extra readings. Later learners run L8, vary the attack scale, then reset before the independent L9 example. Python performs these calculations now. A coordinating agent should request evidence and retain HOLD when a required premise is missing; saved L10B replies show a separate recorded cyber case. Our code uses numerical checks, not the Stanford SMT/MaxSAT runtime.

## 10. Ask four questions about every result

06:00–07:00 / 1 minutes.

Lam’s pp.52–53 distinguish verifiable rationale, explicit assumptions, policy consistency and actionable next conditions. Translate these into four plain questions: which tool supports this claim, which inputs and model were used, were the same limits and service priorities kept, and what must the operator review next? Our power-flow, optimization and evidence-binding checks are numerical/software checks. They do not inherit the lecture’s SMT correctness claims. Ask pairs to apply the questions to one L10B explanation and to the full-scope HOLD at L12. We show only the actual public returned reasons, not hidden chain-of-thought. This closes the twelve-minute opening concept block. Point out that all three labs will use these questions; participants do not need to memorize a framework or run ahead.

## 12. Start Colab in three steps

08:00–10:30 / 2.5 minutes.

For a paced workshop, run the setup cell first, then run each named lesson cell when prompted. Runtime > Run all also works, but it reveals later outputs before the prediction questions. The default route needs no GPU, API key or LLM download. If setup stops, reconnect the runtime and rerun setup before starting L0.

## 13. Run a cell, then read its output

10:30–11:00 / 0.5 minutes.

Point to the three parts: editable input, run control and returned output. The illustrated input lines are the first two lines of the actual L2 cell, not a complete standalone program. The full cell calls the voltage helper and draws two plots. The runtime remembers variables from earlier cells, which is why we run the lesson in order. If NameError reports a missing variable, return to setup/L0 and rerun the required earlier cells. Do not treat a previously displayed output as the result of a number just edited until you rerun its cell. Use the L labels instead of numerical cell indexes. Later cells need earlier variables.

## 14. L0: keep both switches off

11:00–12:30 / 1.5 minutes.

Run all of L0 to import the helpers, configure the plots and initialize the timing record. Keep RUN_OPENDSS=False and RUN_LOCAL_LLAMA=False. These settings skip the optional full-feeder OpenDSS route and local model service. They do not make the calculations prerecorded: L2 and L4 through L9 run fresh numerical calculations or checks, while L12 checks the evidence binding and simulated readback.

## 15. L1: does the old result still match?

12:30–15:00 / 2.5 minutes.

Evidence binding means matching a checked record to the exact inputs, proposed command and returned result, using content hashes. Treat L1 as a same-content check, not a test that a physical action passes its limits. The first row keeps the request and command unchanged. The next two rows change a request field or command field, so binding_pass is True, False, False. A failed match calls for new evidence; it does not prove the changed action fails its limits. A matching hash also does not authenticate a sensor.

## 16. Case 1: which solar settings should we use?

15:00–15:30 / 0.5 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: Imagine an operator comparing possible settings for solar units. Each choice changes power flows. The job is to find an acceptable option while respecting voltage, line-current and unit limits. An agent can organize the requests and responses, while the tool calculates the electrical effects. We first learn those tools in Colab, then inspect saved agent decisions.

Original source detail: The feeder is a synthetic SMART-DS Greensboro-area example, not a measured utility circuit. The command sets active- and reactive-power participation for an inverter fleet. MPC, model predictive control, uses a system model and a short forecast to calculate a plan under limits; here the proposed command is the first step of that plan. SAC, Soft Actor–Critic, is a saved controller learned from rewards. It produces a proposal from old weights without training again. The default calculation covers medium-voltage (MV) phases and MV line currents, with simplified low-voltage (LV) aggregation. Feasible means the proposal passes the limits represented by that model. Compare the penalty score J only after checking those limits; smaller J is preferred for this stated objective. Run L0 and L1 first.

## 17. Two tools suggest different settings

15:30–16:30 / 1 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: MPC means model predictive control. SAC means soft actor-critic, a learned controller. You do not need their algorithms to follow this lab: both simply supply settings for the same check.

Original source detail: MPC uses a model and a short forecast to optimize a plan; this lab applies its first action. SAC is a saved policy learned through reinforcement learning; it produces a new control proposal using old weights, without training again. Neither is the coordinating LLM. The outer agent can choose which permitted study to request. L2 calls both tools directly and displays their checks; this cell alone is not a live LLM agent. Later recorded P3 figures illustrate Llama coordinating the existing tools. Define per unit when the control-limit slide introduces the voltage scale: 1.0 p.u. is the stated base value. Explain MILP and WLS only in their respective cases.

## 18. How the agent helps with solar settings

16:30–18:00 / 1.5 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: Follow the arrows from the operator’s goal to the returned result. If a check fails, the agent can request another permitted trial. If evidence is missing, it can stop and ask. The useful behavior is the choice made after reading the tool result. The tool still performs the electrical calculation.

Original source detail: This is an actual saved Llama 3.1:8b voltage episode, not a fabricated interactive exchange. Call 1 selects VERIFY_SAC_FIRST; the numerical check returns 111.966607 percent of allowed current and two current violations. Call 2 selects USE_MPC_PLAN; its numerical check returns 99.604410 percent of allowed current and no recorded violations. The SAC and MPC tools already exist; Llama does not invent or solve the power flow. The arrows show tool-request, result, next-request, result. Call 3 selects REVIEW_EVIDENCE. Human acknowledgment remains PENDING and equipment_dispatch is False. This separate P3 MV/LV OpenDSS archive differs from the fresh L2 exercise and from L3 test_01. Later voltage slides display the exact public returned reasons; learners can replay the source in L10B after completing the three cases. The fixed comparator reaches the same numerical outcome, so the trace illustrates coordination rather than a proven performance improvement. This recorded example now follows the MPC/SAC definition slide in the voltage case, after Colab setup. It remains a preview; run the complete episode in L10B later.

## 19. The study changes two solar settings

18:00–19:00 / 1 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: Active power supplies energy. Reactive power supports voltage. The inverter’s shared capacity means these settings cannot be chosen independently without checking.

Original source detail: Active power delivers net energy; reactive power supports the AC voltage and current balance. The command uses P_i = a S_i and Q_i = b S_i. Its bounds are 0 <= a <= 1, |b| <= 0.44 and a^2 + b^2 <= 1. Modeled voltages must be between 0.95 and 1.05 per unit (p.u.), where values are divided by a stated base. RATING_FRACTION=0.80 sets allowed current to 80% of the nominal rating. The displayed current percentage uses this reduced allowance as its denominator. Passing the inverter bounds alone does not show that network limits pass.

## 20. A Python function can be a tool

19:00–19:30 / 0.5 minutes.

Find the actual function call on the next slide. The first two cell lines set the load scale and current allowance; the helper returns numerical proposals, checks and a table for plotting. A tool can be an optimizer, simulator, estimator, lookup or evidence checker. It is not the LLM itself. The student initiates this direct function call with the play button. In the separate recorded workflow Llama selects a named action, the Python application validates that action and its inputs, then invokes a permitted numerical function. Do not claim that the L2 helper uses a live agent gateway. Saving a notebook is separate from keeping a runtime: after a reset, rerun setup and earlier cells.

## 21. L2: compare two solar proposals

19:30–22:30 / 3 minutes.

Start with LOAD_SCALE=1.0 and RATING_FRACTION=0.80. The saved SAC actor produces a new proposal by inference; it is not trained in this cell. Both proposals pass the default classroom checks. MPC has the lower current-step J for this case and objective. This single result does not establish a universal control advantage. The output field feasible reports whether the modeled limits pass; current_step_J is this step’s penalty score, and max_allowed_current_pct is maximum current as a percentage of the reduced allowance.

## 22. Read the voltage and current checks

22:30–23:30 / 1 minutes.

The left panel sorts each voltage curve separately. The same horizontal position means the same rank, not necessarily the same physical bus. The right panel reports current relative to the reduced allowance. Use the output table for exact extrema and feasibility; do not decide acceptance from a plot alone.

## 23. Both pass; MPC has the lower score

23:30–24:30 / 1 minutes.

In the reference execution, MPC returns a=0.960307 and b=-0.111114, with Vmin=1.023874 and Vmax=1.038709 p.u. SAC returns a=0.340066 and b=0.014024, with Vmin=1.013243 and Vmax=1.030000 p.u. Values may vary slightly with the solver or dependency version. Lower current use need not mean lower J, because the objective also includes service and control terms. Check feasibility before comparing J. Both voltage extrema are within the stated 0.95–1.05 p.u. band for this represented MV model.

## 24. A limit needs a calculated check

24:30–25:00 / 0.5 minutes.

Stanford connection: the lecture’s WikiChat discussion, pp.17–25, separates finding material from checking factual claims. Apply the habit to a grid study: retrieving a current limit is different from calculating current for a candidate. The displayed 99.604410% value belongs to the separate archived P3 OpenDSS replay, not to the learner’s fresh L2 result. This example supports only that current check under its recorded model. A sentence, retrieved document or citation does not establish full-network feasibility. Treat the input limits as the task policy. A text source describes the rule; the solver evaluates the particular proposal.

## 25. Exercise 1: lower the current allowance

25:00–28:00 / 3 minutes.

Three minutes to predict, edit and run; debrief on the following one-minute answer slide. Allow one minute to predict, two minutes to edit and run, and one minute to report. Keep LOAD_SCALE=1.0. Reference allowed-current use is 78.527895% for MPC and 54.854158% for SAC; both remain feasible. Do not ask learners to find a rejection that this edit does not produce. The default model still covers MV only.

## 26. Exercise 1 answer: both options still pass

28:00–29:00 / 1 minutes.

At LOAD_SCALE=1.0 and RATING_FRACTION=0.75, MPC is feasible with 78.527895% current use and J=0.0311038194. Saved SAC is feasible with 54.854158% current use and J=0.4324637539. Lower J is preferred only among feasible candidates. These are fresh three-phase linear MV checks, not a full MV/LV study. Restore RATING_FRACTION=0.80 and rerun all of L2 before continuing.

## 27. Less current does not mean the best option

29:00–30:00 / 1 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: The active-power setting is about 0.9603 for MPC and 0.3431 for SAC in this exercise. Lower solar output can reduce current but also increase the stated cost.

Original source detail: Use this visual immediately after the first exercise debrief. It shows the measured reference MPC outputs, rounded to two decimal places, for RATING_FRACTION 0.80 and 0.75. The SAC result is also computed in the notebook but is not drawn here. Both proposals pass this particular tighter test. The result is not a general guarantee for other loads or limits. Ask pairs to explain the denominator in the percentage. Restore the default before moving to L3’s independent archived case. This combines the original numerical debrief with the visual explanation. Compare both methods before restoring RATING_FRACTION=0.80.

## 28. L2: restore the starting values

30:00–30:30 / 0.5 minutes.

Make the experiment boundary explicit. L3 loads a separate preserved context into pool. It does not inherit the fresh L2 case or the participant's edits. Do not pair an edited L2 result with the test_01 model explanation as though the model had seen those new inputs.

## 29. Separate a new calculation from a replay

30:30–31:00 / 0.5 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: A fresh calculation answers the inputs you just supplied. A replay shows what happened previously. Both are useful, but they answer different questions.

Original source detail: Point to these evidence modes throughout the session. Default classroom cells calculate fresh results without a live language-model call. L10B displays verified historical Llama choices, original reasons and associated recorded results. Changing your L2 or L6 input does not change those old replies. The final control-room diagrams are a proposed teaching design, not evidence of a deployed utility platform. No new equipment operation occurs in any of these modes. FRESH means calculated during the current execution. SAVED POLICY means old weights used for new inference. ARCHIVED ACTUAL LLM means an old reply with its original inputs and timing. This slide comes just before L3 so the distinction is applied immediately.

## 30. L3: inspect saved model choices

31:00–32:00 / 1 minutes.

The output contains three actual replies from the frozen response-selection study. Ask learners to identify the operation and numerical parameters requested by each reply. The reported seconds measure the original model calls, not today's display cell. Keep this archived context separate from the fresh L2 comparison.

## 31. Different replies can request the same action

32:00–32:30 / 0.5 minutes.

The three old replies reduce to two distinct operations after matching their tool names and numerical parameters. The vote keeps one contribution per model. In test_01, two models vote for the Q-relaxation trial, which relaxes a reactive-power restriction in that declared test. This diagram shows the old input and choices; it is not a new vote after a learner edits L2. Grouping matching trials avoids counting different wording as different physical proposals.

## 32. L4: check the chosen proposal

32:30–33:30 / 1 minutes.

The selector is frozen and makes no training updates in this lesson. L4 applies the archived selected operation to its original test context and runs a fresh numerical check. This is a replay with new verification, not a new language-model decision or an online learning experiment. LinUCB is a learned selector that scores the available choices from context; its saved settings stay fixed here.

33:30–34:00 / 0.5 minutes.

The reference J is about 0.031082 for both selectors. The predicted reward is around -0.0075. It is a learned score, not a feasibility flag. Read new_check_passes for the engineering result. This one case does not show that learned selection is better than voting.

## 34. L5: see which part of the grid was checked

34:00–35:30 / 1.5 minutes.

L5 rebuilds the original test_01 case and runs a new check on its original MV-MPC incumbent, meaning the baseline plan saved with that case. This is not the reactive-power-relaxation candidate checked in L4. With RUN_OPENDSS=False, L5 checks only the reduced model and reports that OpenDSS is disabled. This CPU route performs no new full-feeder AC check. A wider-model study saved earlier is not a result calculated today. Model scope means the network parts and physical effects that a check represents.

## 35. A PASS covers only what was checked

35:30–36:00 / 0.5 minutes.

Ask a participant to read the explicit scope message aloud. A PASS is conditional on the model and action that were checked. The default model does not cover every LV constraint. A more confident explanation cannot supply the missing model coverage.

## 36. Recorded example: the first option fails

36:00–37:00 / 1 minutes.

Read the exact reason. The model was offered VERIFY_SAC_FIRST or REVIEW. The application then checks the saved SAC action in OpenDSS. 111.966607% refers to the allowed current, which was 80% of nominal, so this exceeds the configured allowance. The numerical result records two current violations. This P3 full supplied MV/LV study is separate from L2 and L3 test_01. Ask the audience to predict the next allowed step before advancing. This slide is a recorded preview beside the matching case. Do not run ahead to L10B yet. Keep the named L2–L9 cells in order; after L10, use L10B to inspect all three complete episodes. The source label locates the replay rather than the current classroom calculation.

## 37. Recorded example: request another option

37:00–38:00 / 1 minutes.

The model selects USE_MPC_PLAN from two allowed choices, the other being REVIEW. It does not invent or solve MPC. The recorded context already supplies a plan and its eligibility. The application performs a fresh numerical check at that historical time. The result is just below the allowed current threshold. No operating permission follows from this check alone. Ask which evidence, rather than wording, makes the fallback eligible for review. This slide is a recorded preview beside the matching case. Do not run ahead to L10B yet. Keep the named L2–L9 cells in order; after L10, use L10B to inspect all three complete episodes. The source label locates the replay rather than the current classroom calculation.

## 38. Recorded example: return to the operator

38:00–39:00 / 1 minutes.

Read the exact REVIEW_EVIDENCE choice and distinguish it from the overall status. The proposed controls are 2387.157 kW and +325.738 kvar. The supplied full MV/LV feeder check returned voltage 1.001783–1.035026 p.u. and zero listed violations. The fixed supervisor used the same SAC-to-MPC sequence with identical numerical output. Recorded workflow intervals were 0.346053 s fixed and 3.110454 s agentic, excluding precomputed MPC/SAC preparation. These are single recorded timings, not performance distributions or a measured reduction in operator workload. This slide is a recorded preview beside the matching case. Do not run ahead to L10B yet. Keep the named L2–L9 cells in order; after L10, use L10B to inspect all three complete episodes. The source label locates the replay rather than the current classroom calculation. End-of-case partner check: L2 makes new proposals; L3 shows old replies; L4–L5 run new checks on test_01. Report the inputs, proposal, model coverage and result before naming the next step. Give pairs 30 seconds to describe the sequence without calling every step an AI decision. L2 calculates an MPC plan and a saved-policy proposal for the current classroom inputs. L3 displays old model replies. L4 runs new checks of the selected trials; L5 checks the original archived plan and its model coverage. Numerical tools provide the physical evidence. The old model choices select a permitted trial; they do not replace these checks. The operator receives an advisory record whose stated coverage must match the request. The three P3 previews are an additional separate archive. Contrast their saved Llama decisions with your current direct function calls.

## 39. Case 2: who gets power after a fault?

39:00–39:30 / 0.5 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: A fault removes one normal supply path. Alternative paths have limited capacity, so the operator must choose what to restore. Serving critical demand first can differ from maximizing the total power served. The agent can carry that priority into a study request, collect the result and request a new study when the situation changes.

Original source detail: This six-node graph is separate from the voltage feeder. It represents active-power transport, not AC power flow or a time-ordered field switching procedure. Loads are picked up as whole blocks. A tie is an alternative connection that can supply load; CAPACITIES_KW sets its transfer limit in kilowatts.

## 40. How the agent helps restore service

39:30–40:30 / 1 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: The operator supplies the goal. The numerical solver chooses loads under the network rules. An agent could manage the study request and read its result, but it should not invent the service priority. L6 runs the tools directly; the recorded agent example comes later.

Original source detail: Critical demand totals 90 kW: 60 kW at node 2 and 30 kW at node 5. The objective is the service goal encoded as a score. The priority score gives more weight to these critical loads, while the comparison score maximizes total kW. The difference in selected service comes from that goal. Both numerical methods use the same graph, capacities and whole-load pickup rules. Neither needs a language model to solve this declared problem.

## 41. L6: compare two restoration goals

40:30–42:30 / 2 minutes.

MILP means mixed-integer linear programming. Here it is a whole-load chooser: on/off choices decide which load blocks are served, while linear constraints enforce the stated network rules. Start with tie capacities of 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 kW. The solver enforces active-power balance, capacity limits, connection to a source, no loops in the energized graph, and exclusion of the faulted branch. An independent exhaustive search checks the priority score on this small graph. Agreement supports this formulation; it does not check the AC physics left out of the model.

CAPACITIES_KW = (40., 60., 80., 100., 120.)
started = time.perf_counter()
restoration = lab.restoration_sweep(CAPACITIES_KW)
```

## 42. Read total and critical service

42:30–43:30 / 1 minutes.

The markers show sampled capacities rather than a continuous ramp between whole-load pickup plans. A higher capacity may still be too small to add another complete load block. Read both total and critical service before choosing the policy that matches the request.

## 43. The service goal changes who gets power

43:30–44:30 / 1 minutes.

Compare the first two output rows, where tie_capacity_kw=40. The priority plan serves 10 kW less total demand while preserving 60 kW more critical demand. These results compare two service objectives, not AI with no AI.

## 44. Check the restoration plan

44:30–45:00 / 0.5 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: The result must respect the unavailable faulted branch and the model’s supply and capacity rules. A field switching sequence needs additional operating work.

Original source detail: Numerical checks and same-content evidence matching answer different questions. A record can match the inputs exactly while still omitting AC voltage, reactive-power or protection limits. Comparing the MILP score with every permitted plan is an independent check of this small stated problem. Minimizing energized branches does not calculate the number or order of physical switching steps.

## 45. Exercise 2: increase tie capacity

45:00–48:00 / 3 minutes.

Three minutes to predict, edit and run; debrief on the following one-minute answer slide. Allow one minute to predict, two minutes to edit and run, and one minute to report. At 180 kW, both methods serve 250 kW total and 90 kW critical demand. Keep 40 kW first in the list because L7 binds the first result to the first capacity. Do not reorder the list for this exercise.

## 46. Exercise 2 answer: capacity changes the trade-off

48:00–49:00 / 1 minutes.

At 40 kW tie capacity, priority-weighted MILP serves 130 kW total and 90 kW critical. The unweighted maximum-kW policy serves 140 kW total and 30 kW critical. In the sampled list, outcomes first match at 80 kW; they also match at 100, 120 and 180 kW. At 180 kW, both serve 250 total and 90 critical kW. Do not infer the exact continuous crossover from this discrete sweep. Keep 40 first, restore the original list and rerun L6 before L7.

## 47. More capacity can remove this trade-off

49:00–50:00 / 1 minutes.

Compare the 180 kW result with the 40 kW case before generalizing. Equal service at 180 kW follows from this small graph and its demands; it is not a universal threshold. A single success percentage would hide the service-policy question.

## 48. L7: change the request, then check the evidence

50:00–51:30 / 1.5 minutes.

Keeping 40 kW first already preserves the L7 example. Resetting the list also makes the saved notebook easy to compare with the default. L7 changes the request capacity and revision without solving a new case. It tests whether the old evidence can still be used.

```

## 49. The old result no longer matches

51:30–52:00 / 0.5 minutes.

This output reports evidence binding, not physical infeasibility. A separate fresh solve at 20 kW still gives the 130 kW total and 90 kW critical priority outcome on this graph. L7 itself does not run that solve. Replace the stale evidence because it belongs to a different request, even when the old plan might remain feasible.

## 50. A new limit needs a new study

52:00–52:30 / 0.5 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: An agent can notice the changed request, ask the tool to solve it again and return the new checks. Rewriting the old explanation would not update the calculation.

Original source detail: Evidence binding asks whether a record matches the exact request, proposed plan and returned result. The diagram’s extra topology labels are teaching illustrations. The runnable L7 example changes only the request capacity and revision; students do not change topology in that cell. Old evidence is unusable for a changed request even if the old plan might still pass its limits. Ask which new numerical check would establish that for the changed request.

## 51. The agent keeps the operator’s goal

52:30–53:00 / 0.5 minutes.

This is a proposed role for an agent, not a new model decision in the default notebook. The current supervisor is ordinary Python. A future language-model agent could request the allowed solve and explain the returned tradeoff. It must preserve the operator’s service goal and limits, rather than quietly changing weights or making up load values. A different service goal requires an explicit new request and solve. The numerical difference here comes from the optimization objective.

## 52. This model leaves some checks for later

53:00–53:30 / 0.5 minutes.

## 53. Recorded example: try more service

53:30–54:30 / 1 minutes.

Switch L10B to restoration. This is the separate L10 feeder-catalog restoration study, not the L6 six-node MILP. The recorded protocol requires a first refinement but Llama chooses between the offered fractions. SHED_075 disconnects 75% of the ordered noncritical load objects, not 75% of load kW. The exact reason calls improvement a possibility. Python evaluates the trial and finds improved service while the tie loading remains 91.867215% of its allowance. A useful hypothesis becomes evidence only after that check. This slide is a recorded preview beside the matching case. Do not run ahead to L10B yet. Keep the named L2–L9 cells in order; after L10, use L10B to inspect all three complete episodes. The source label locates the replay rather than the current classroom calculation.

## 54. Recorded example: the tool rejects a trial

54:30–55:00 / 0.5 minutes.

Keep the actual returned reason visible. It refers to a target in the objective, but its claim should not be accepted as a proved fact. In this record the next trial is numerically rejected for a thermal failure. Restoring more load does not make a failed current check acceptable. Ask participants to explain why the previous passed candidate must remain in the case record. The model’s trial budget is bounded. This slide is a recorded preview beside the matching case. Do not run ahead to L10B yet. Keep the named L2–L9 cells in order; after L10, use L10B to inspect all three complete episodes.

## 55. Recorded example: correct a wrong ranking

55:00–56:00 / 1 minutes.

Let pairs answer before discussing the result. Smaller cost is better, so E03 must rank before E02. Llama returns [E02,E03] while its explanation claims lowest score first. The recorded language_order_agrees_with_cost field is False. A deterministic guard retains E03 and rechecks it as E05, with no recorded failures. Human acknowledgment and dispatch remain False. The paired fixed workflow reaches the same final action and cost. This example motivates verification rather than an unsupported superiority claim. This slide is a recorded preview beside the matching case. Do not run ahead to L10B yet. Keep the named L2–L9 cells in order; after L10, use L10B to inspect all three complete episodes. The source label locates the replay rather than the current classroom calculation. End-of-case partner check: At 40 kW, explain 130 total / 90 critical versus 140 total / 30 critical, all in kW. For a changed request, keep HOLD until evidence for the current request is available. Ask each pair to give one number and one condition. They should distinguish three decisions: selecting a service policy, checking current evidence and authorizing a physical switching operation. Ask which step was chosen by Llama in the recorded example, which returned result came from software, and what the operator must review. These previews use a separate archived case; L10B later displays the full source.

## 56. Case 3: can we trust these readings?

56:00–56:30 / 0.5 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: The operator sees measurements, not the true system state. Several altered readings can agree with each other and still lead to a wrong estimate. An agent can request tests and organize the evidence, but it cannot create a trusted measurement source. The lab uses known simulated changes so that we can compare fit with actual estimation error.

Original source detail: The separate four-bus linear DC model has three unknown voltage angles, measured relative to a reference bus, and eight readings. This DC approximation is not a full AC estimator, malware detector or sensor-authentication system. Synthetic truth is known for the offline classroom comparison only. A residual checks how well the estimate fits the supplied readings; state error checks how far the estimate is from the known teaching truth.

## 57. Mismatch is only one check

56:30–57:30 / 1 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: In the cyber lab, J is a mismatch statistic, not the control cost used in the voltage lab. A low mismatch says the model fits the readings; it does not authenticate them.

Original source detail: WLS means weighted least squares: find the state that best fits the readings, giving more influence to readings with smaller stated uncertainty. That weighting does not authenticate a reading. Here J is the residual mismatch statistic, not the voltage case’s penalty score. Its chi-square alarm threshold is about 15.086272 for five residual degrees of freedom at a 1% significance level. This calibration depends on the stated linear model and noise assumptions. An operator does not have the synthetic truth used to calculate the plotted state error. A small J does not establish that the readings are authentic.

## 58. L8: compare two misleading-data patterns

57:30–59:30 / 2 minutes.

L8 runs new WLS calculations. An isolated bias changes one reading. The coordinated Hc shift changes readings in a pattern consistent with a different modeled state. This counterexample assumes knowledge of the linear measurement matrix H and access to the modeled unprotected channels. It is a declared defensive teaching model, not evidence of an incident at a utility.

## 59. Read the alarm and the estimation error

59:30–60:30 / 1 minutes.

The left plot uses a symmetric-log scale. The right plot compares the estimate with known synthetic truth. As the coordinated shift grows, the residual stays unchanged while the state error increases. These plots answer different questions; they do not express the same quantity in different units.

## 60. A coordinated change can escape the alarm

60:30–61:30 / 1 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: The coordinated changes preserve a small mismatch even as the estimate moves away from the known state. This is the reason a quiet alarm is incomplete evidence.

Original source detail: The diagram is a simple scalar illustration of coordinated consistency, not the numerical eight-measurement system. Read the numerical values from L8. A larger false-data shift need not increase the residual when the shift lies in the modeled measurement subspace. The state error is measured in radians; it is available here because this is an offline test with known synthetic truth.

## 61. Exercise 3: test a small bias

61:30–64:30 / 3 minutes.

Three minutes to predict, edit and run; debrief on the following one-minute answer slide. Allow one minute to predict, two minutes to edit and run, and one minute to report. For isolated bias at scale 0.10, J is about 10.143237, below the 15.086272 threshold. The alarm is False despite nonzero state error. The coordinated residual stays about 3.920222. This added scale remains within the notebook's plot limits.

## 62. Exercise 3 answer: no alarm can hide an error

64:30–65:30 / 1 minutes.

At scale 0.10, isolated bias gives residual J=10.143237 and state error 0.0008057145 rad. Coordinated Hc gives J=3.920222 and state error 0.0025529499 rad. Both are below the 15.086272 alarm threshold, so both alarm flags are False. This J is a residual statistic, unlike the voltage-control objective J. State error is available here because simulation truth is known. Restore the original ATTACK_SCALES and rerun L8 before the separate fixed L9 recovery case.

## 63. A small bias can stay below the threshold

65:30–66:30 / 1 minutes.

Separate the two mechanisms. A small isolated bias can stay below a statistical threshold. A coordinated Hc shift can preserve residual consistency by construction. Neither result establishes trusted telemetry. The state-error curve uses offline synthetic truth, not an input available to an online detector.

## 66. Trusted readings must come from somewhere

67:30–68:00 / 0.5 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: The lesson supplies a trust assumption so that the numerical task can be studied. The calculation is not a method for proving sensor identity or integrity.

Original source detail: The example assumes three protected angle readings determine the three unknown angles, leaving zero residual degrees of freedom. Independent trusted information must come from a justified source outside this numerical calculation. A zero residual in this exactly determined system adds no detection guarantee. Neither a good model fit nor a language-model explanation establishes authenticity.

## 67. L9: read HOLD or PROPOSE first

68:00–69:30 / 1.5 minutes.

The two calls use the same fixed fixture and change only protected_available. Without the trusted channels, the result is HOLD. With the assumed trusted set, it is PROPOSE. A proposal is neither an acknowledgment nor a dispatch command.

```

## 68. Missing trust means HOLD

69:30–70:30 / 1 minutes.

Read the condition column together with the returned state. The PROPOSE outcome depends on the supplied trust assumption and fixed model. The recovery record keeps dispatch=False. It does not use the equipment_dispatch field from the separate L12 readback example.

## 69. The tool calculates a small correction

70:30–71:00 / 0.5 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: Per unit, written p.u., expresses a value relative to a chosen model base. Compare the predicted and offline checked flow with the same 0.18 limit.

Original source detail: QP means quadratic programming: this numerical solver minimizes a quadratic effort score while enforcing the declared branch limits and a 0.01 p.u. margin. The flexible injection is u=0.1216936673 p.u., balanced by the reference bus. Predicted flow12 is 0.17000 p.u.; the offline actual flow is about 0.17046 p.u., below the 0.18000 p.u. rating. The actual-flow comparison uses synthetic truth for this fixed case. It does not guarantee AC behavior omitted by the model or trustworthy field telemetry.

## 70. How the agent helps with suspicious readings

71:00–71:30 / 0.5 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: Follow the information from the readings to the proposed correction. Without the required trusted data, the workflow returns HOLD. With that assumption, the tool can calculate a candidate. The agent can request these steps and explain missing checks; the operator must still assess the premise and decide the authorized next step.

Original source detail: Do not attribute recovered information or numerical feasibility to confident prose. The workflow can coordinate the estimator, constrained correction and evidence checks. It cannot invent an independent trusted measurement source.

## 71. Recorded example: request the recovery tool

71:30–72:00 / 0.5 minutes.

Switch L10B to cyber. This standard four-bus DC record is separate from L10’s proposal-complete cyber record, and matches the Agent Trace notebook T6 archive. The route is narrow: the prompt already authorizes the tool and supplies the trusted-sensor assumption. The three angle readings give full rank but zero residual redundancy, so a good fit is not an independent trust test. u is the flexible injection correction in per unit. Offline synthetic-truth flow is available to the experimenter, not guaranteed available to a real operator. This slide is a recorded preview beside the matching case. Do not run ahead to L10B yet. Keep the named L2–L9 cells in order; after L10, use L10B to inspect all three complete episodes. The source label locates the replay rather than the current classroom calculation.

## 72. Recorded example: keep human review

72:00–73:00 / 1 minutes.

Read the actual reply, including the REVIEW choice. Numerical verification is PASS, but the overall result remains REVIEW and human acknowledgment is PENDING. The fixed comparator obtains the same numerical state estimate and correction without Llama. This replay demonstrates permitted tool routing and a report decision. It does not demonstrate better estimation, authenticated measurements, AC network security or operating authority. Run L11 with the default False setting, then proceed to L12. This slide is a recorded preview beside the matching case. Do not run ahead to L10B yet. Keep the named L2–L9 cells in order; after L10, use L10B to inspect all three complete episodes. The source label locates the replay rather than the current classroom calculation. End-of-case partner check: Report the trust assumption, model, proposed u and the checks that passed or failed. Without independent trusted information, keep HOLD and name what is missing. Ask pairs to state the outcome and its condition in the same sentence. For example: 'The fixture proposes u when the supplied trusted channels are available.' Do not say: 'The AI proved that the telemetry is safe.' Ask which step was chosen by Llama in the recorded example, which returned result came from software, and what the operator must review. These previews use a separate archived case; L10B later displays the full source.

## 73. L10: inspect the saved sequence of jobs

73:00–74:30 / 1.5 minutes.

L10 reads the archived proposal_complete_workflow study. It includes feeder-catalog restoration and is separate from the L6 six-node MILP and your edited classroom inputs. L10B, inserted immediately after L10, then gives readable verified replay episodes for all three cases. Run L11 after those replays; the default False setting skips a new local model request.

## 74. L10B: replay each saved agent example

74:30–79:00 / 4.5 minutes.

Run L10 first. In the new L10B cell the helper validates the original JSON reply against the parsed journal and trace, then displays the recorded episode. Change only SCENARIO to inspect the other two episodes. Earlier case slides previewed selected fields from these replays. Now inspect the full episodes in the same notebook. This cell makes no model request and performs no new electrical solve. At the end, run L11 at its default False setting before L12. Llama reasons are historical public returned text. Their correctness must be judged against the input and tool results. SCENARIO can be voltage, restoration or cyber. The full cell is shown. Allow about a minute and a half per scenario: one partner identifies the model choice, the other finds its tool result and the unresolved operator decision. These additional minutes replace removed checkpoint slides and the longer source explanations.

## 75. L12: practice checking the recommendation ID

79:00–81:00 / 2 minutes.

This cell returns to the original test_01 voltage result through selected_trials. It does not use the restoration or cyber sweeps. Read both scope outcomes and explain why the full MV/LV request remains HOLD. The new simulated acknowledgment grants no physical operating authority and does not complete the review of an old record. Readback means repeating the recommendation ID and conditions so the acknowledgment can be matched to the same proposal. In this exercise it is simulated. Check the wrong-ID rejection, the correct simulated acknowledgment and equipment_dispatch=False.

## 76. Approval must match the checked study

81:00–82:00 / 1 minutes.

After running the complete L12 cell, compare these reference outputs with your own. The full MV/LV request remains HOLD because the checked model covers only MV phases. An explicit MV teaching request can pass the simulated readback after the recommendation ID matches. The wrong-ID attempt is rejected. Acknowledgment records a classroom review step and does not operate equipment.

## 77. Five roles share the work

82:00–83:30 / 1.5 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: The five roles are five jobs rather than five independent language models. Python reads the case, calculates and verifies. One Llama model requests initial trials and later refinements. Python also guards the final ranking and rechecks the selected option. The default notebook displays these saved stages.

Original source detail: This is a custom, role-based Python workflow. It is not five independent LLMs. One Llama 3.1:8b model is called with the Planning Agent and LLM Optimizer roles. Awareness, simulation and verification run Python. The default notebook displays saved role traces in L10 and saved selected episodes in L10B; it does not execute a new multi-agent LLM run. The handoff is structured case facts, candidate IDs, tool results and checks, not an invented agent conversation. src/proposal_workflow.py defines CORE_STAGES, run_proposal_case, evaluate and the ranking guard. A final independent recheck precedes MODEL_RECOMMEND. Human acknowledgment remains separate and pending. Hash checks detect changed records but do not authenticate telemetry.

## 78. Voltage: request, calculate, check, improve

83:30–84:30 / 1 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: This is the separate saved L10 medium-voltage example. New settings return to calculation and checking. Its final recorded current use is about 50.75% of the allowance.

Original source detail: This is a custom, role-based Python workflow. It is not five independent LLMs. One Llama 3.1:8b model is called with the Planning Agent and LLM Optimizer roles. Awareness, simulation and verification run Python. The default notebook displays saved role traces in L10 and saved selected episodes in L10B; it does not execute a new multi-agent LLM run. The handoff is structured case facts, candidate IDs, tool results and checks, not an invented agent conversation. src/proposal_workflow.py defines CORE_STAGES, run_proposal_case, evaluate and the ranking guard. A final independent recheck precedes MODEL_RECOMMEND. Human acknowledgment remains separate and pending. Hash checks detect changed records but do not authenticate telemetry. In this L10 lindistflow3 record, the optimizer asks for RELAX_Q_10_PERCENT then INCREASE_PV_0025. Python recalculates each proposal and the verification stage checks it. The selected final recheck uses a=0.3394386941 and b=0.0276310594, with 50.75344954 percent allowed-current use and no recorded violations. The scope is MV phases only with ideal LV aggregation. Do not substitute the P3 99.604410 percent result or L2 MPC score. These are different experiments.

## 79. Restoration: keep priorities and reject failures

84:30–85:30 / 1 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: In the saved feeder case, a trial at about 111.01% current use is rejected. The retained plan serves about 1843.61 kW total and 474.04 kW critical.

Original source detail: This is a custom, role-based Python workflow. It is not five independent LLMs. One Llama 3.1:8b model is called with the Planning Agent and LLM Optimizer roles. Awareness, simulation and verification run Python. The default notebook displays saved role traces in L10 and saved selected episodes in L10B; it does not execute a new multi-agent LLM run. The handoff is structured case facts, candidate IDs, tool results and checks, not an invented agent conversation. src/proposal_workflow.py defines CORE_STAGES, run_proposal_case, evaluate and the ranking guard. A final independent recheck precedes MODEL_RECOMMEND. Human acknowledgment remains separate and pending. Hash checks detect changed records but do not authenticate telemetry. The L10 lindistflow3 restoration record uses a feeder bypass catalog. SHED_075 returns 1843.61355 kW served and 474.03975 critical kW at 91.86721465 percent allowed-current use. SHED_065 then fails at 111.009413 percent. Llama ranks E02 before E03 even though E03 has the smaller cost. The numerical guard selects E03, then records the final recheck as E05. Switching sequence and broader physical operation are not established.

## 80. Cyber: keep the trust assumption visible

85:30–86:30 / 1 minutes.

Plain-language explanation: The saved cyber example keeps the assumed trusted readings visible throughout the workflow. Repeating or explaining that assumption does not establish its truth.

Original source detail: This is a custom, role-based Python workflow. It is not five independent LLMs. One Llama 3.1:8b model is called with the Planning Agent and LLM Optimizer roles. Awareness, simulation and verification run Python. The default notebook displays saved role traces in L10 and saved selected episodes in L10B; it does not execute a new multi-agent LLM run. The handoff is structured case facts, candidate IDs, tool results and checks, not an invented agent conversation. src/proposal_workflow.py defines CORE_STAGES, run_proposal_case, evaluate and the ranking guard. A final independent recheck precedes MODEL_RECOMMEND. Human acknowledgment remains separate and pending. Hash checks detect changed records but do not authenticate telemetry. Awareness preserves the declared measurement-trust condition. Planning requests the initial candidates; Python runs the estimator and constrained-response tools. The optimizer requests EXTRA_MARGIN_001 and TRUSTED_QP. The selected final recheck uses TRUSTED_QP with u=0.1216936673 per unit and predicted flow12=0.17 per unit against a 0.18 limit. The model checks a four-bus DC fixture with three protected angles assumed trustworthy. No stage authenticates those channels, and offline truth is not fed to Llama.

## 82. Measure whether the agent helps

87:30–88:30 / 1 minutes.

The six matched fixed-versus-Llama runs in proposal_complete_workflow.json have five tied final costs and one worse Llama voltage result. Recorded model calls add elapsed time. This demonstrates traceable coordination, not better power-flow solvers or general efficiency. Test any proposed benefit against the same tools and budgets. A control-room pilot starts with archived cases, then read-only shadow studies and a limited reviewed scope.
